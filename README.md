        # Cisco Group Password Decrypter

## Using

The application can be used to decrypt "encrypted" group passwords stored in Cisco VPN configuration profiles.  This can be useful if you have a Cisco VPN profile, but would like to configure another system that does not natively support Cisco VPN profiles.  For example, if you would like to use the native VPN support within Ubuntu (or other Linux distros) you must have the plaintext group password to configure the connection.  The tools is relatively straightforward, simply paste in the encrypted password and click the "Decrypt" button.
